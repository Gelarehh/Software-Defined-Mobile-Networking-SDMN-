# Software-Defined Mobile Networking (SDMN)
Legacy cellular networks suffer from inflexible and expensive equipment, complex control-plane protocols, and vendor-specific configuration interfaces. Nowadays, mobile network architectures need to evolve to cope with demand for high bandwidth, a large and evolving set of services with new specific requirements, high-level security, low energy consumption, and optimal spectrum utilization.

Specifically, the increasing number of mobile users and services will increase the mobile network's increasing capacity requirements. It is expected that mobile data traffic will grow faster than the fixed Internet during the upcoming years. Thus, accommodating this expected traffic growth is an imminent requirement of mobile networks.

In order to keep up with the traffic growth, mobile networks have to go through architecture processes to optimize the current resources and add new components/technologies that increase the capacity.

Software-Defined Mobile Networking or **SDMN** is an architecture for carrier networks, that builds on the decoupling of data and control in the mobile network user plane, increasing the operator innovation capability.
